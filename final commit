<p class="paragraph-font">We humans spend life living in our own worlds of emotion, lost in thoughts we 
consider unchosen, sometimes refusing to want to continue this "victimized" existence
that we've unknowingly created.  But Life is more than that I found.  We get lost in
the fog and don't realize quite yet that there is a way to step outside of that. 
Once you find the way, you'll look at the wonder that exists, just as we do and 
see it as beautiful, harmonious, expressions of LOVE, of Art, of Intelligence.</p>
<p>Feel the air, the oxygen that runs through your nose and into your lungs filling 
you completely and then being exhaled as CO2 to feed the plants that you live amongst. 
We are a part of something greater here.  If you look up to the sky, you've got to see 
it, right?  Or have you locked yourself up in the world you've created?  All it takes 
it is for you to crack a window open so that you can have a glimpse to what you're 
really a part of.  Maybe we spend so much time inside our own minds in order to 
eventually bring us to the realization of something greater.  Everything does start 
with an invisible form.  An idea, right?  How did I find that idea for myself?  Well, 
the practice of meditation brought me to Life.</p><p>You always have thoughts that drift 
through your mind like clouds.  I practice choosing my thoughts. I chose to place a thought
in my head, a thought that made me experience a divine presence permeating every cell and 
fiber of my being and beyond that.  Something, that is One but permeates through all as all. 
Something that feels like unconditional Love, unshakeable Peace, Intelligence, Creativity, Bliss. 
What a wonderful thing to experience.  I believe once I realized that, I saw what I was a part of 
and I began experiencing "LIFE".</p><p>A quick way to appreciate life is to be in the present.  Here a few steps that can help you find that:
<ul><li>Find a quiet place</li><li>Sit comfortably, take a deep breath in and exhale slowly</li>
<li>As you continue to breathe feel the air and listen to the sounds</li><li>Relax your body and close
your eyes as you continue to breathe deeply</li></ul>
<p>Life is all there is.  Although I don't always walk around in this realization, everytime I feel
a breeze through my hair, or I hear a bird, or a see a smile from someone, 
something fills me and I realize with that one exhale that this "Thing" permeates all of existence 
whether seen or unseen by my eyes.  I am immersed in It.  Science classes are great to take with 
the detailed look on life, down to the invisible.  I believe linking spirit (not religion) and 
science could solve many problems we experience today and I know there's already proof of it taking 
place.</p><p2 class="animated bounce">I found a nice little video that has a written meditation and beautiful scenery that I'm
